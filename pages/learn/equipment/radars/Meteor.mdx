## Description

The powerful, high-precision METEOR 500 Doppler radar is particularly used in tropical regions with extremely heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms providing reliable, high-resolution data at real-time equivalent update rates to support online weather analysis and short - term forecasting.

- Meteor 500 C (former so-called “ C-Band”) 5,45 - 5,82 GHz
- Meteor 500 S (former so-called “ S-Band”) 2,7 - 2,9 GHz
  Notice: S band radars (frequencies are so-called E-Band now) are used in the tropics because they can see beyond a severe storm

The METEOR 500 is using a magnetron- based transmitter, coherent-on-receive Doppler technique and a digital receiver.
